PyISIS

# Introduction

I have started this project around 2008 while working in collaboration of the Team from Bireme/PAHO/WHO.

This is one of the original versions.

Later, Luciano Ramalho replaced me on this project, and I bet he made lots of enhancements. But this code base has only my very humble code.

This version hosted by Gustavo Fonseca is probably more up-to-date https://bitbucket.org/gustavofonseca/pyisis/src/master/
